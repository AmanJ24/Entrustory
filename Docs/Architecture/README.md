# ENTRUSTORY Architecture Pack (Phase 1)

This folder contains the concrete Phase 1 architecture deliverables translated into build-ready technical specifications.

## Contents

1. `01-system-architecture.md` — component model, runtime boundaries, and deployment topology.
2. `02-data-flow-contracts.md` — sequence-level data flow for create-version and verify-proof paths.
3. `03-trust-boundaries.md` — explicit trust zones, attack surfaces, and controls.
4. `04-key-management.md` — signing key lifecycle and operational controls.
5. `ADR/` — architecture decision records used to lock technical choices before implementation.
